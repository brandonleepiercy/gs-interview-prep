# 10 General Interview Questions

## 1. Tell me about yourself
- Keep the answer brief
- Keep the answer on topic/related to the job position
- Talk about where you went to school or how you got started in the field you're interviewing for
- Use the job description to find out what you should say

## 2. Why should we hire you
- Use the job description to figure out what exactly they are looking for
- Articulate why your skills and experiences make you the best fit for the job
- Use your knowledge of the industry and their competitors to demonstrate you know what their problems are and how you can contribute to solve them

## 3. What are your greatest strengths
- This does refer to your perception of your strengths in a broad sense. 
- e.x. Good leader, good time management, good communicator etc. 
- Talk about 2 or 3.
- This should match with the job description.

## 4. What is your biggest weakeness
- Just be honest and stop having an ego about having shortcomings literally everybody does.
- Talk about something that you are actually bad at, and what you are doing to overcome it.

## 5. Why do you want to work here
- Be honest, just tell them why you want to work there.
- Obviously the reasons can sound better if you can articulate things about the company.
- Do research and talk about social initiatives or things you like about the industry.

## 6. What is your biggest accomplishment
- This is a question about a specific project that was completed
- Try talking about your career and use something personal if absolutely neccessary (no more career stories to tell don't repeat unless you are attempting to elaborate on a different aspect)

## 7. Describe a difficult problem and how you overcame it
- The interviewer wants you to talk about how you worked together with a team to overcome a problem
- Either overcoming the intellectual difficulty of a task or overcoming problems with teamwork
- If you're talking about how you helped unite your team or something else that relates to other co-workers, do not talk down about other co-workers. It is okay to be honest about legitimate work-related short comings as long as you are tactful with the language, but it should be avoided to kept to an absolute minimum to avoid the impression that you talk behind other people's backs regularly.

## 8. Where do you see yourself five nears from now
- Ideally your answer should be related to the logical progression of your job
- If you are an entry level front-end engineer talk about how you want to get a foot in, possibly move up to full stack and get to be a team leader in 5 years
- Start short term and move long term, and talk about why you want these things otherwise it will seem canned

## 9. Do you have any questions for us
- Never say "no"
- Ask real questions about your job
- If you don't have any questions you honestly might want to look for another job that should really indicate you aren't interested in the job
- If this comes towards the end (which it should) you can ask something broad like ("Do you feel like I'm a good fit for the position?") This shows you care, just don't get too weird and needy
- If you have a list of questions you should definitely ask them during the interview if natural opportunities present themselves in the conversation. This is much better than waiting till the end to rattle off a list of other questions. This just makes another interview happen within the interview instead of making one interview feel like a natural conversation, which absolutely biases interviewers to "like" candidates over others.
