# Queues

## Overview
- Queues and stacks are both very similar and simple data structures. A queue is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of a queue and removed from the front of a queue. It models the First In First Out (FIFO) inventory principle. In javascript they are typically implemented with an array, shift() and push() methods.
