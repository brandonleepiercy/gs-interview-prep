# Arrays

## Overview
An array is a collection of items of a single type. It can be an array of integers, or strings, but it can't/shouldn't be a mix of both. Doing so would hinder the functionality of an array.

## Implementation
Implementation of an array in Javascript is simple as arrays are programmed to be native Javascript functions. Using "[]" denotes anything inside the brackets is a part of the array.
